# Introduction
## Where this repository comes from 
This repository is the work from, and for, the cs439 midterm: *"Twitter Data Analysis"*.   
[The course](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/course-synopses/course-details/01-198-439-introduction-to-data-science) 
was taken during Fall 2022  

*(The data used in the project was scraped before Elon Musks purchase of Twitter)*   

## What has been removed 
When assigned, this assignment was to be done by either:  

- In a Group, but all 7 parts must be submitted   
- Or Done individually, and only parts 2 - 6 are required    

This project was done individually 
-- part 1 and 7, plus misc. blocks (such as the "insert name" block) -- 
have been removed to focus on parts 2 - 6.

# Description   
The notebook imports a csv of Trumps Tweets (Jan. 1, 2016 - Oct. 16, 2018).  
Then the following actions were *taken: 

- Clean data 
- Reformat/alter the data   
- Make new dataframes and series from that data
- Present data (using print, show(), or graphing library(s) such as seaborn)  

**The steps above were done without a particular order, 
nor equal amount of times*

# Running it
## Which files
To look at the answers, open:    
"`midterm.github.submission.ipynb`"

To validate if the answers are correct -- (what the teacher *expected*) -- open:  
"`midterm.github.reference.ipynb`"

## Why the exceptions in 5.2 - 6.2    
The reason for the exception is because the answer for 5.1 was given to us by the professor.   
Since the answer sheet wasn't updated after, **the answers are different, but not wrong**.
